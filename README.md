## A. Scenario

In this lab you will get your hands dirty with the JAM Stack, a very modern way of building a website, and get a first site up that are using J(avaScript) A(PIs) and M(arkup).

## B. What you will be working on today

Today you will be building a blog using some of the most common tools to do this:

* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)  to build/generate the site
* [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) to store and deliver the content
* [Netlifly](https://www.netlify.com/) to deploy the site

## C. Lab instructions

There are many good articles out there. We have supplied you with a starter template with some boilerplate code. It's based off of the contentful-starter referenced in the article below. However, you will use the code in this repo rather than cloning a new template linked in the article.


1. Follow this guide to get started with the contentful setup. Clone this repo instead of the one suggested in the article.
https://www.contentful.com/r/knowledgebase/gatsbyjs-and-contentful-in-five-minutes/

2. Create your own GitHub repo and push this code to it.

3. Inspect the codebase and try to understand how it's setup.

4. Create a "products" page to display a list of products similar to how the "blog" page is set up.
  * This page should display a list of products from Contentful. You need create a new Content Model and add content for this to work.
  * You should be able to click on a product to be redirected to a product page.

5. Create an account of Netlify and deploy your application by linking to your GitHub repo.

Good luck and have fun!
